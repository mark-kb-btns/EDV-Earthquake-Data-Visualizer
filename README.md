# EDV: Earthquake Data Visualizer
EDV is a tool designed to visualize earthquake data sourced from the USGS API. Users can customize various parameters, enabling the program to present data in multiple formats, such as plotted maps, charts, tables, and more.

Developed as part of a university computer science curriculum, EDV is an academic project, not a professional product. Its purpose is to showcase the studentâ€™s proficiency in Java and general programming skills.
